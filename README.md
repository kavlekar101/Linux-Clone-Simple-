# Linux-Clone-Simple-

This is just a simple Linux Clone that implements, or atleast tries to implement 10 different commands. There are some memory leaks that I am working on,
but overall it works pretty well. The commands are, cd, rm, mkdir, rmdir, cp, touch, pwd, ls, cat, and help (in part1)

In the part2 executable, there are also 4 custom commands that include longest file name, longest folder name, numberoffilesandfolders, 
and finally dirPrint, which tries to visually show the path to the current node in a tree fashion.

Finally, in the part3 executable, before accepting commands, the program loads in the names of all of the files in the current directory (up to 64 files).
